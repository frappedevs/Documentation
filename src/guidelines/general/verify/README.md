# Discord Verification
::: warning Important notice
Mobile users may not be able to finish the verification process due to emoji inconsistency.

Please copy-paste the emoji segment rather than typing it.
:::

We have created a Discord server for staffs and customers to have communications.

However, unless you have verified your Roblox account in the Discord server, you are not able to talk in any channels.

This page contains a detailed walkthrough on verifying your account –– for those who are struggling from it.

## Requirements

A Discord user must meet the requirements below before verifying:

- Joined Discord at least 1 month ago
- Have your phone number linked with Discord
- Have a Roblox account
- Above the age of 13

## Steps
### Start the verification process

To start the verification process, type the command `!verify` in the **Verification** channel.

The verification bot will soon respond with a message, asking for your Roblox's username/Id.

Respond back with your Roblox account's username or user Id.

### Verify account ownership

Before granting access, we need to make sure the account is owned by you, not by others.

The bot will respond with a message, which contains a segment of emojis. **Copy-paste** the segment, and put into your Roblox's blurb ("About" section of your profile), and press save.

Within seconds, the bot will add the corresponding roles for a verified member. Verification is complete.
